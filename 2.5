1.Cluster :

   A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers.
   
   They can be viewed as a single system.

   Computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.
   
   It helps in performing multitasking since nodes can work parallelly;

   HDFS has one namenode and one or more data nodes.

 Hadoop Cluster :
 
   Hadoop cluster is a computational cluster designed for storing and analyzing various types of data (structured,semi structured,unstructured).
 
   Hadoop clusters consist of namenode and datanodes.
 
   Large Hadoop Clusters are arranged in several racks.
 
   Network traffic between different nodes in the same rack is much more desirable than network traffic across the racks. 



2.  Components of Hadoop 1.x
 
There are 5 components in Hadoop 1.x :

   1.NameNode

      Contains the Hadoop FileSystem Tree. 

      It stores metadata information about files and directories
      
      It acts as a single point of failure.


   2.Secondary Namenode

     Performs periodic merging of namespace and edits

     This is not a back up for NameNode


   3.Data Node

    Stores actual data blocks of file in HDFS on its own local disk

    Sends signals to NameNode periodically (called as Heartbeat) to verify if it is active
    
    Sends block reporting to the NameNode on cluster startup as well as periodically atevery 10th Heartbeat

    The DataNode are the workhorse of the system

    They perform all the block operations, including periodic the Checksum.
 
    They receive instructions from the NameNode of where to put the blocks and how to put the blocks.

   4.JobTracker 
 
    It Controls overall execution of map reduce jobs


   5.TaskTracker 

    It Runs individual map-reduce jobs on DataNodes

    It Periodically communicates with the JobTracker to give updates and receive instructions
